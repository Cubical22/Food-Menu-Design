## Food-Menu-Design
A really simple but well-made menu, just an Idea I had for a restaurant (not a real one).
Has some functionality implemented.

## Viewing the project
To view this project you can't just simply use the dir inside of a browser (mainly cause of the imports done on Css and the images)
Instead, you have to make a local server and open the Html file using it.
Here are some solutions:
  1. Using `nodeJs` if installed, just simply run `npx serve` on the main dir to start a local server.

  2. Using vs code, the `live server` plugin can be used on the project.

  3. Using `Wamp` if you're feeling crazy, and

  4. ...

## Why made?
Just for practice and experience, also thought maybe the implementation may seem interesting to some people.
Simply, handling the animations and button states was fun doing in javascript.

I'll also soon upload this to my resume, with my name included, but feel free to take inspiration for now :)
